### Abstract
Let$X ={X(t), t \in [0, T]}$ be a second order random process of which _n_ independent realizations are observed on a fixed grid of $p$ time points. Under mild regularity assumptions on the sample paths of $X$, we show the asymptotic normality of suitable nonparametric estimators of the trend function $μ=EX$ in the space $C([0,T])$ as $n,p \to \infty$ and, using Gaussian process theory, we derive approximate simultaneous confidence bands for $μ$.
