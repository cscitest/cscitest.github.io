## Abstract
We study the nonparametric estimation of the mean function of a random process indexed by a compact metric space. We elaborate on the asymptotic variance and prove asymptotic normality for a general class of linear estimators. An application to simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed and investigated by simulation.
